Start of development: February 2019.

> In the beginning, I wanted to use some _APIs_ to do a search portal, with web search, image search, news, and shopping. But I couldn't do better than Google SERPs or personalized news they are serving so I decided to focus on a different "shopping" experience than available in the market, based on videos with reviews. -- Dirceu

## Tech

Static files are generated to be stored and hosted on Firebase Hosting for maximum performance and CDN. JavaScript is used in some dynamic functions as asynchronous content loading. The layout is fluid and responsive.
