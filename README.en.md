Start of development: February 2019.

> In the beginning, I wanted to use some _APIs_ to do a search portal, with web search, image search, news, and shopping. But I couldn't do better than Google SERPs or personalized news they are serving so I decided to focus on a different "shopping" experience than available in the market, based on videos with reviews. -- Dirceu

## Prototype

<img align="left" width="200" src="https://github.com/dirceup/junior123-public/blob/master/images/junior123-prototipo.png" /> Initially, as can be viewed in the image beside (from February 2019), it would be offered a menu with the most popular categories in e-commerce, the principal content would be high-resolution images from best-selling products in each category and the right side menu would be a shortcut to page scroll (to go direct to desired product).

## Actual

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://github.com/dirceup/junior123-public/blob/master/images/junior123-atual.png" /> After changes in Buscapé and Lomadee it is without search and price comparison features. Only offered in Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) version, there is a menu with the most popular categories in e-commerce, the principal content are [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) videos from best-selling products of each category.

## Tech

<img align="left" width="62" src="https://github.com/dirceup/junior123-public/blob/master/images/header-ruby-logo@2x.png" /><img align="right" width="62" src="https://github.com/dirceup/junior123-public/blob/master/images/js-logo.png" />Developed as a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) script that uses both standard HTTP library and [typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus) to accesses data about categories and products from [Lomadee API](https://developer.lomadee.com/) and videos listing from [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/). Static files are generated to be stored and hosted on Firebase Hosting for maximum performance and CDN. JavaScript is used in some dynamic functions as asynchronous content loading. The layout is fluid and responsive.
